# 📦 Zepto SQL Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing an e-commerce grocery dataset (Zepto-style) using **SQL** to extract meaningful **business insights**.  
The objective is to demonstrate strong skills in **data exploration, data cleaning, aggregation, and business analysis** using structured queries.

The dataset used in this project is sourced from **Kaggle** and adapted for analytical and educational purposes.

## 🧠 Business Problem Statement
E-commerce platforms generate large volumes of product and inventory data.  
The challenge is to:
- Identify high-value and high-discount products
- Understand category-wise revenue contribution
- Analyze inventory availability and stock risks
- Support pricing, marketing, and supply-chain decisions using data

This project answers these questions using SQL-based analysis.

- `sku_id` – Unique product identifier  
- `category` – Product category  
- `name` – Product name  
- `mrp` – Maximum Retail Price (₹)  
- `discountPercent` – Discount percentage  
- `discountedSellingPrice` – Final selling price  
- `availableQuantity` – Units available in inventory  
- `weightInGms` – Product weight  
- `outOfStock` – Stock availability flag

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **SQL (PostgreSQL compatible syntax)**
- **Relational Database Concepts**
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation**
- **Business-Oriented Data Analysis**

---

## 🔍 Key Analysis Performed
- Data validation and cleaning (null checks, invalid prices)
- Product-level discount and pricing analysis
- Category-wise revenue estimation
- Inventory risk and stock availability analysis
- Product segmentation based on weight
- Value-for-money analysis using price-per-gram

## 📊 Business Insights Covered
The project answers the following business questions:
1. Top 10 best-value products based on discount percentage  
2. High-MRP products that are currently out of stock  
3. Estimated revenue contribution by product category  
4. Premium products with minimal discounts  
5. Categories offering the highest average discounts  
6. Best value products based on price per gram  
7. Product segmentation by quantity (Low / Medium / Bulk)  
8. Total inventory weight distribution by category  

Each SQL query is documented with **clear business explanations** directly in the script.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
1. Create the database and table using `Zepto_SQL_schema.sql`
2. Import `zepto_dataset.csv` into the table
3. Execute queries from `Zepto_Business_Insights.sql`
4. Review outputs and insights per business question
